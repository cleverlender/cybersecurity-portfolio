# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me

I became interested in cybersecurity through a growing curiosity about how systems work behind the scenes and how attackers are able to exploit small mistakes to gain access. What started as a general interest in technology quickly turned into an interest in security once I realized how important defensive thinking and problem solving are in this field. I am still early in my cybersecurity journey and am focused on building strong fundamentals through hands-on practice and structured learning.

## CTF Experience Reflection

Participating in this Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge helped me understand how real-world security issues often come down to misconfigurations and small oversights rather than complex attacks. As a beginner, I learned the importance of slowing down, enumerating what access I already have, and carefully observing how programs behave before trying advanced techniques. The challenge reinforced that privilege escalation does not always require gaining a shell, and that simply accessing restricted data can be enough to achieve an objective. Overall, the experience increased my confidence in approaching security problems methodically.

## CTF Highlights

- Identified a misconfigured sudo permission that allowed a user to run a program as root without a password  
- Reviewed source code to understand how user input was handled  
- Used basic enumeration and observation to locate and read a root-only file  
- Practiced documenting each step clearly to ensure the solution was reproducible
